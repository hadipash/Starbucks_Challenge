### Capstone Project
#### [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program â€“ Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t)

This project was developed with Anaconda Python 3.6 distribution. It contains all necessary frameworks and libraries
to run the project, so no additional installations needed. For clean Python distributions all the project
requirements are specified in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed through `pip`:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The project's entry point is in the `analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.  
The lambda function used in the deployment stage is located in `lambda_function.py`.
